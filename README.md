Internet-Shop using NodeJS, Express, MongoDB and SendGrid. You can register your account, update your own  information in "Profile" tab. 
After creating you will receive a confirmation letter on your e-mail.  
Also, you can recover your password using e-mail. 

After authentication you can create your own course, add some courses to the cart, edit items in the cart and make an order.  
To look at the orders list go to the "Orders" tab. This site is protected from CSRF attacks, using CSRF tokens.  
Sessions are stored in MongoDB. 

Now, this site is running on free hosting "Heroku".  
That's why photos in "Profile"  are available only during active session.
